Hello, and welcome to the training ground.

If you are not already aware, you are here to rid the office of the unwanted visitors that 
have found their way in.

This should be an easy task for you, but if you want to, you can use this room to familiarize
yourself with your equipment.

Walk forward towards the leftmost table to proceed.

In the top left you will see a panel with useful information about your status.

This includes things like health, which will be important later.

You can also see the amount of ammunition left in your weapons.

In the bottom left you will see another panel.

This panel tells you the weapons you have at your disposal, as well as the one which you are currently using.
